    <p>
        Looks like you either reached the end of the Internet, or are looking
        for something that's missing.  Maybe you should <a href="/">Upload your
        project</a> and fix your Python standards!
    </p>
    <p>It's also possible that you hit a bug.  Are you sure the pep8 script is
       in your path?  Also, maybe you typed an incorrect url to upload.
