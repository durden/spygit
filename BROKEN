- Our error handling is pretty weak so if we can't download the git repo for some reason we
  are just sending users to 404.
- You might not have the pep8 script in your path if you keep seeing projects without any
  pep errors.
- We are randomly picking a dash project to auto-fill in the upload form with.  Thus, some
  of them might be really out of whack or not work.
- Only tested in Firefox and Safari (linux/mac versions).
- Some projects might take a LONG time.  We didn't implement the ability to handle the jobs
  in the background.  This could cause you go get some timeouts during uploading.
